# How to Load Custom P3D Files in The Simpsons: Hit & Run
 
The Simpsons: Hit & Run is a classic game that has a large modding community. One of the ways to customize the game is to load custom P3D files, which are the files that contain the 3D models, textures, animations and sounds of the game. P3D files can be created or edited using tools like Blender or P3D Editor.
 
In this article, we will show you how to load custom P3D files in The Simpsons: Hit & Run using an example of a mod that replaces the sound effects of the cards in the game with new ones. The mod is called **cardsfx.p3d** and it can be downloaded from [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301050).

## Step 2: Copy cardsfx.p3d to your game folder

## Step 3: Load cardsfx.p3d using LoadP3DFile command
 
The final step is to load the cardsfx.p3d file using the LoadP3DFile command in a script file. The LoadP3DFile command is used to load a P3D file into the game's memory. It takes three parameters: the filepath of the P3D file, the allocator and the slot. The allocator is a string that specifies how the game should allocate memory for the P3D file. The slot is a number that specifies which slot in the game's memory should be used for the P3D file.
 
The easiest way to load cardsfx.p3d is to use a level's load script (level.mfk) or a mission's load script (mXsdl.mfk, mXl.mfk, srXl.mfk, bm1l.mfk or gr1l.mfk). For example, if you want to load cardsfx.p3d in Level 1, you can edit level01.mfk and add this line at the end:
 `LoadP3DFile("Mods\\cardsfx.p3d", "Global", 0);` 
This will load cardsfx.p3d into slot 0 of the global allocator. You can use any slot number from 0 to 255, but make sure it does not conflict with other P3D files that are loaded by the game or other mods. You can also use different allocators depending on your needs. For more information on LoadP3DFile command and its parameters, you can check out [DT Docs](https://docs.donutteam.com/docs/hitandrun/scripting/mfk-commands/loadp3dfile).
 
## Step 4: Enjoy your new card sound effects!
 
That's it! You have successfully loaded cardsfx.p3d into The Simpsons: Hit & Run. Now you can enjoy your new card sound effects in the game. Have fun!
  
## How to Unload Custom P3D Files in The Simpsons: Hit & Run
 
If you want to unload a custom P3D file that you loaded using the LoadP3DFile command, you can use the UnloadP3DFile command. The UnloadP3DFile command is used to unload a P3D file from the game's memory. It takes one parameter: the slot number of the P3D file that you want to unload.
 
For example, if you want to unload cardsfx.p3d from slot 0 of the global allocator, you can edit level01.mfk and add this line at the end:
 `UnloadP3DFile(0);` 
This will unload cardsfx.p3d from slot 0 of the global allocator. You can use any slot number from 0 to 255, but make sure it matches the slot number that you used for loading the P3D file. You can also use different allocators depending on your needs. For more information on UnloadP3DFile command and its parameter, you can check out [DT Docs](https://docs.donutteam.com/docs/hitandrun/scripting/mfk-commands/unloadp3dfile).
 
## How to Edit Custom P3D Files in The Simpsons: Hit & Run
 
If you want to edit a custom P3D file that you downloaded or created for The Simpsons: Hit & Run, you can use tools like Blender or P3D Editor. Blender is a free and open source 3D creation suite that can be used to create or modify 3D models, textures, animations and sounds. P3D Editor is a tool that can be used to view or edit P3D files directly.
 
To use Blender, you will need to install a plugin called [SHAR P3D Blender Plugin](https://github.com/ColouMods/SHAR-P3D-Blender-Plugin), which allows you to import and export P3D files in Blender. You can download it from GitHub and follow the installation instructions there. After installing the plugin, you can open Blender and import or export P3D files using the File menu.
 
To use P3D Editor, you will need to download it from [Donut Team](https://donutteam.com/downloads/5/). After downloading it, extract it to your game folder and run P3DEditor.exe. You can open or save P3D files using the File menu. You can also drag and drop P3D files into the program window.
 
Both tools have their own advantages and disadvantages. Blender has more features and flexibility, but it has a steeper learning curve and may not support all the features of P3D files. P3D Editor has less features and flexibility, but it has a simpler interface and may support more features of P3D files. You can use either tool depending on your preference and needs.
